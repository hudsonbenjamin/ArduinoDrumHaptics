ArduinoDrumHaptics
==================

The code was developed as a part of few days long project in the 
summer school TESP 2012 Robotics at Tohoku University, Japan. 
The purpose of the system was to take audio input, either mic or 
directly from the phone/tablet, analyse sound frequencies and amplitude 
and provide a haptic feedback using four vibration actuators.

The system was demonstrated by using a simulated drums app on an Android 
tablet while getting a haptic feedback to your wrists as you play using 
our unique conductive drumsticks :-) Simple matching of frequency changes gave 
a realistic effect.

The project was based on Arduino Uno board and it was the first time using Arduino 
for us. Hardware used:
* Arduino Uno board
* Spectrum Analyzer https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10306
* 4x vibrating actuators
* 2x 2 channel Amplifiers
* Asus Transformer Prime as a drumset
